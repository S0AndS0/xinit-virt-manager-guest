  "&#x1F531; Tips for forking xinit-virt-manager-guest"


> Tips for forking xinit-virt-manager-guest


Start making a [Fork][xinit_virt_manager_guest__fork_it] of this repository to an account that you have write permissions for.


- Add remote for fork URL. The URL syntax is _`git@github.com:<NAME>/<REPO>.git`_...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/S0AndS0/xinit-virt-manager-guest

git remote add fork git@github.com:<NAME>/xinit-virt-manager-guest.git
```


- Commit your changes and push to your fork, eg. to fix an issue...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/S0AndS0/xinit-virt-manager-guest


git commit -F- <<'EOF'
:bug: Fixes #42 Issue


**Edits**


- `<SCRIPT-NAME>` script, fixes some bug reported in issue
EOF


git push fork main
```


> Note, the `-u` option may be used to set `fork` as the default remote, eg. _`git push -u fork main`_ however, this will also default the `fork` remote for pulling from too! Meaning that pulling updates from `origin` must be done explicitly, eg. _`git pull origin main`_


- Then on GitHub submit a Pull Request through the Web-UI, the URL syntax is _`https://github.com/<NAME>/<REPO>/pull/new/<BRANCH>`_
